/**
 * A file reader capable of reading forward and backward through a file as
 * needed. Two markers are kept at a fixed distance between each other. This
 * distance, known as the spreadLimit, is the maximum number of lines allowed
 * between the two markers before they are both shifted in the appropriate
 * direction upon the next line read.
 * <p/>
 * The goal of this file reader is to allow a program to read a file without
 * storing all of the previously read lines in memory. This allows for a very
 * low memory footprint when reading very large files.
 * <p/>
 * Note that a ScrollingFileReader is not a subclass of Reader from the Java IO
 * libraries.
